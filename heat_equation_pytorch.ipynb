    "# Neural Network that solves the Heat Equation\n",
    " The objective of this notebook is to create a NN that solves the heat equation with a certain initial value and boundary conditions in an interval $[-1,1]$ for a time interval $[0,T]$.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Define the network class with a loss function that solves the heat equation. leave room for initial condition and boundary condition loss terms?\n",
    " * Write functions that train and validate the network.\n",
    " * Write functions that plot the solution and the loss over the pochs\n",
    " * Define the training data in the domain.\n",
    " * Instantiate and train a baseline network. Validate it.\n",
    " * cross val with different architectures"
